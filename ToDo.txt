ToDo: 
- sanitize input!
	- check that binary files are only float/ints
		* using struct.unpack translates everything to floats, sufficient for scrubbing? 
	- check structure of ascii files. 
- admin page with options/prices
	- generate output based on options/prices
	- SSL cert for localhost/deployment
	    - For all cookies set the HTTPOnly and Secure flag
    	- Make sure login pages are only served on HTTPS and all authenticated pages are only served on HTTPS
    	- Don't trust any user data (input, headers, cookies etc). Make sure to validate it before using it 
    -add escaping and validation for all form fields.
    
- STL preview in page
- Robust error checking: 
	- set up tests for:
	- catch if no file uploaded
- handle URLs: 
	eg: http://www.thingiverse.com/download:274010
		- May need to write logic to parse file objects, no because there appears to be no guarantee that I can gulp the entire file over the network. 
- handle ascii format
- drag and drop?
- file validation: 
	- size
	- solid? 
	- small regions?
	- overhangs?
	- other issues?
- generate gCode?
Done!
- binary files
- handle units, 
- error checking:
	- error message if vol is =< 0
