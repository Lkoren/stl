ToDo: 
- Audit/confirm that everything relevant is properly escaped/encoded. 
		* using struct.unpack translates everything to floats, sufficient for scrubbing? 
	- check structure of ascii files. 
- Form validation:
	- strings in the number field crash the server. 
	- catch if no file uploaded
- some basic CSS.


- SSL cert for localhost/deployment
    - For all cookies set the HTTPOnly and Secure flag
	- Make sure login pages are only served on HTTPS and all authenticated pages are only served on HTTPS	      
- STL preview in page

Extra: 
- handle URLs: 
	eg: http://www.thingiverse.com/download:274010
		- May need to write logic to parse file objects, no because there appears to be no guarantee that I can gulp the entire file over the network. 
- handle ascii format
- drag and drop?
- file validation?: 
	- solid? 
	- small regions?
	- overhangs?
	- other issues?
- generate gCode?
- admin favicon
Done!
- sanitize input!
	- check that binary files are only float/ints.
		-relevant code is HTML escaped. 

- binary files
- handle units, 
- error checking:
	- error message if vol is =< 0	
- admin page with options/prices
	- generate output based on options/prices	
-add escaping and validation for all form fields..
-1_in cube, uploaded with in units, gets zero vol.
- need a way to do GET on the current printer_options file.
- If not logged in to goog, admin login page fails. 
	- user validation/authentication fixed.
